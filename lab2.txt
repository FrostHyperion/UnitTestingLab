1. abstraction :- Hiding the unnecessary details and showing only the essintial features. 
example, We use the bluetooth but i really have no idea, how a bluetooth manages works behind the scenes.
     
      code example:

                         abstract class Language {
                               // fields and methods
                                          }


2. Inheritence :- Accquiring the properties from base class or parent class to child class or sub class.
example, Child and parents all the properties of father are inheriated by his son.

code example:
             Class OS{
                  //fields and methods
                         }



                // kali os accqires properties from os

                    class Kali{
                          //fields and methods of os
                          //fields and methods of Kali
                         }

3. Encapsulation :- Wrapping and binding the code and data into a single unit.
example, A cell phone is a great example. I have no idea how the cell phone connects to a satellite, tower, or another phone.
 I have no idea how the damn thing understands my key presses or how it takes and sends pictures to an email address or another phone number.

         code example:
                          using system; 
                public class office {  
               private string departname;.......  
                // Accessor.  
    public string GetDepartname() {  
        return departname;  
    }  
               // Mutator.  
    public void SetDepartname(string a) {  
        departname = a;  
    }  
}  


4.Polymorphoism :- poly means many and morph means forms .Its the ability of a message to be displayed in more than form.
example, A person at the same time  can have different characteristics.

    code example:
           public class TestData  
{  
    public int Add(int a, int b, int c)  
    {  
        return a + b + c;  
    }  
    public int Add(int a, int b)  
    {  
        return a + b;  
    }  
}  
class Program  
{  
    static void Main(string[] args)  
    {  
        TestData dataClass = new TestData();  
        int add2 = dataClass.Add(45, 34, 67);  
        int add1 = dataClass.Add(23, 34);  
    }  
}
